## Design

### Level 3
- [ ] No code repetition
- [ ] Strong modularity and separation of concerns
- [ ] Clean interfaces: variables and arguments are passed minimally and predictably; minimizes surface area of possible errors
- [ ] Consistent and predictable code

### Level 2
- [ ] Some code repetition
- [ ] Some modularity and separation of concerns
- [ ] Mostly clean interfaces: some unnecessary data flow
- [ ] Mostly consistent and predictable code

### Level 1
- [ ] Code repetition
- [ ] Little modularity and separation of concerns
- [ ] Somewhat clean interfaces: some unnecessary data flow and excessive exposure to sources of errors
- [ ] Possibly inconsistent and unpredictable code

## Style

### Level 3
- [ ] Clear symbol names (i.e. variables, functions, etc.)
- [ ] Code is very easy to read and reason about; predictable and consistent
- [ ] Well-documented: easy to understand design choices and intent
- [ ] Proper and easy to read indentation, spacing, and formatting

### Level 2
- [ ] Named symbols, but sometimes confusing
- [ ] Code is legible but sometimes hard to interpret; mostly predictable and consistent
- [ ] Intent not always clear
- [ ] Proper and easy to read indentation, spacing, and formatting with some minor issues

### Level 1
- [ ] Possibly confusing symbol names
- [ ] Generally illegible code; possibly unpredictable and inconsistent
- [ ] Intent not well understood from code
- [ ] Some or many formatting issues
